### Features

Enabling the Beeminder integration gives you three new features:

| Feature                                      | Format                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Post all new tasks to Beeminder on creation  | Applies to all new tasks   |
| Post to Beeminder goal(s) on task creation   | `[Task Name] &[Goal Slug]` |
| Post to Beeminder goal(s) on task completion | `[Task Name] *[Goal Slug]` |

When a task is posted to Beeminder as a new datapoint, the following attributes are set:

| Datapoint Field | Value                                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Date            | Date task was added, or completed if using `*`-tag                  |
| Value           | Always `1`                                                          |
| Comment         | Task summary, e.g., `The Task by 3/24/2021, 11:59 PM or pay $10.00` |

#### Examples

> Go shopping

On **creation** of the task, the default Beeminder goal you specified in your settings will receive a datapoint of 1.

> Go shopping &shopping

On **creation** of the task, your `shopping` Beeminder goal will receive a datapoint of 1, in addition to your default goal.

> Go shopping &shopping &chores

On **creation** of the task, your `shopping` and `chores` goals will both receive a datapoint of 1, in addition to your default goal.

> Go shopping \*shopping

On **completion** of the task, your `shopping` Beeminder goal will receive a datapoint of 1. In addition, your default goal will receive a datapoint of 1 when the task was created.

> Go shopping \*shopping &chores

On **creation** of the task, your `chores` Beeminder goal will receive a datapoint of 1, in addition to your default goal.

On **completion** of the task, your `shopping` Beeminder goal will receive a datapoint of 1.
