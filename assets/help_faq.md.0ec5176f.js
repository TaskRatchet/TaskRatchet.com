It acts like a simple todo list, letting you define your tasks and check them off when they are done.</p><h2 id="is-taskratchet-free" tabindex="-1">Is TaskRatchet free? <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-taskratchet-free" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Yes! TaskRatchet is free to use forever. You will only be charged if you don&#39;t complete a task you&#39;ve added by the deadline you chose.</p><h2 id="why-does-taskratchet-need-my-payment-details" tabindex="-1">Why does TaskRatchet need my payment details? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-does-taskratchet-need-my-payment-details" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>TaskRatchet allows you to commit to completing tasks by a deadline. If you don&#39;t make your deadline, you get charged the amount you pledged on the task. Without your payment details, TaskRatchet isn&#39;t effective at ensuring you meet the deadlines you&#39;ve set.</p><h2 id="when-does-taskratchet-charge-me" tabindex="-1">When does TaskRatchet charge me? <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-does-taskratchet-charge-me" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Soon after you miss a deadline, TaskRatchet will email you letting you know you&#39;re about to be charged, and a charge will appear in your bank account. You can reply to this email to pause the charge and let me know that the charge isn&#39;t legit. Once I&#39;ve canceled a charge, it will disappear from your bank account.</p><h2 id="can-i-try-taskratchet-out-without-adding-my-payment-details" tabindex="-1">Can I try TaskRatchet out without adding my payment details? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-i-try-taskratchet-out-without-adding-my-payment-details" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>TaskRatchet is not designed to be used without a payment method. Since any charges for late tasks won&#39;t succeed without valid payment details, TaskRatchet won&#39;t be able to enforce the commitments you&#39;ve made. For that reason, new users are required to add a payment method during the registration process.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-unsubscribe-from-the-daily-summary-emails" tabindex="-1">How do I unsubscribe from the daily summary emails? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-unsubscribe-from-the-daily-summary-emails" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Email me at <a href="mailto:nathan@taskratchet.com">nathan@taskratchet.com</a> and I can unsubscribe you from the daily emails.</p><h2 id="how-can-i-deactivate-or-delete-my-account" tabindex="-1">How can I deactivate or delete my account? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-can-i-deactivate-or-delete-my-account" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Email me at <a href="mailto:nathan@taskratchet.com">nathan@taskratchet.com</a> letting me know whether you&#39;d like me to delete or just deactivate your account, and I&#39;ll get it done as soon as I can.</p><h2 id="does-taskratchet-support-paypal" tabindex="-1">Does TaskRatchet support PayPal? <a class="header-anchor" href="#does-taskratchet-support-paypal" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>No, but email me at <a href="mailto:nathan@taskratchet.com">nathan@taskratchet.com</a> anyway to let me know you&#39;re missing it! I&#39;ll probably also ask you where you&#39;re located and if there are any other payment methods that might work for you.</p><h2 id="why-doesn-t-taskratchet-have-feature" tabindex="-1">Why doesn&#39;t TaskRatchet have [feature]? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-doesn-t-taskratchet-have-feature" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>TaskRatchet is built and maintained by a single developer, so I may plan to have certain features that I just haven&#39;t had the time to build yet. Or, maybe I haven&#39;t thought of the feature yet! Email me at <a href="mailto:nathan@taskratchet.com">nathan@taskratchet.com</a> with any ideas, suggestions, or feedback. I love hearing your ideas!</p><p>You can also suggest and vote for ideas <a href="https://taskratchet.consider.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, though I would recommend that you also email me, since I keep a separate record of missing features and the users who want them.</p>',20),r=[h];function n(d,i,c,l,u,m){return t(),a("div",null,r)}var k=e(o,[["render",n]]);export{p as __pageData,k as default};
