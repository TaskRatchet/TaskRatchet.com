It acts like a simple todo list, letting you define your tasks and check them off when they are done.</p><h3 id="how-is-taskratchet-different-from-beeminder" tabindex="-1">How is TaskRatchet different from Beeminder? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-is-taskratchet-different-from-beeminder" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>First, <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/taskratchet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TaskRatchet and Beeminder go great together</a>, so definitely check out <a href="https://taskratchet.com/help/integrations.html#beeminder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Beeminder integration</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.beeminder.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beeminder</a> and TaskRatchet are quite similar--they are both tools for committing yourself to future behaviors by putting money on the line. However they differ in several ways:</p><ol><li>TaskRatchet has a very simple todo list interface, whereas Beeminder exposes a much more complex and powerful user interface.</li><li>TaskRatchet only supports binary commitments, whereas Beeminder lets you track anything that can be quantified.</li><li>TaskRatchet is focused on tracking your current commitments, whereas Beeminder also has a great deal of utility as a tool for collecting quantified-self style historical data.</li><li>TaskRatchet supports one-off commitments as a first-class citizen, whereas Beeminder is built strictly for ongoing commitments, making very short-term commitments difficult to manage using the platform.</li></ol><p>We like to think that these differences allow Beeminder and TaskRatchet to complement each other by allowing for a broader range of use cases than one alone could support.</p><h3 id="why-doesn-t-taskratchet-have-feature" tabindex="-1">Why doesn&#39;t TaskRatchet have [feature]? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-doesn-t-taskratchet-have-feature" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>TaskRatchet is built and maintained by a single developer, so I may plan to have certain features that I just haven&#39;t had the time to build yet. Or, maybe I haven&#39;t thought of the feature yet! Email me at <a href="mailto:nathan@taskratchet.com">nathan@taskratchet.com</a> with any ideas, suggestions, or feedback. I love hearing your ideas!</p><p>You can also suggest and vote for ideas <a href="https://taskratchet.consider.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, though I would recommend that you also email me, since I keep a separate record of missing features and the users who want them.</p><h2 id="payments" tabindex="-1">Payments <a class="header-anchor" href="#payments" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><h3 id="is-taskratchet-free" tabindex="-1">Is TaskRatchet free? <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-taskratchet-free" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Yes! TaskRatchet is free to use forever. You will only be charged if you don&#39;t complete a task you&#39;ve added by the deadline you chose.</p><h3 id="why-does-taskratchet-need-my-payment-details" tabindex="-1">Why does TaskRatchet need my payment details? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-does-taskratchet-need-my-payment-details" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>TaskRatchet allows you to commit to completing tasks by a deadline. If you don&#39;t make your deadline, you get charged the amount you pledged on the task. Without your payment details, TaskRatchet isn&#39;t effective at ensuring you meet the deadlines you&#39;ve set.</p><h3 id="when-does-taskratchet-charge-me" tabindex="-1">When does TaskRatchet charge me? <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-does-taskratchet-charge-me" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Soon after you miss a deadline, TaskRatchet will email you letting you know you&#39;re about to be charged, and a charge will appear in your bank account. You can reply to this email to pause the charge and let me know that the charge isn&#39;t legit. Once I&#39;ve canceled a charge, it will disappear from your bank account.</p><h3 id="can-i-try-taskratchet-out-without-adding-my-payment-details" tabindex="-1">Can I try TaskRatchet out without adding my payment details? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-i-try-taskratchet-out-without-adding-my-payment-details" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>TaskRatchet is not designed to be used without a payment method. Since any charges for late tasks won&#39;t succeed without valid payment details, TaskRatchet won&#39;t be able to enforce the commitments you&#39;ve made. For that reason, new users are required to add a payment method during the registration process.</p><h3 id="does-taskratchet-support-paypal" tabindex="-1">Does TaskRatchet support PayPal? <a class="header-anchor" href="#does-taskratchet-support-paypal" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>No, but email me at <a href="mailto:nathan@taskratchet.com">nathan@taskratchet.com</a> anyway to let me know you&#39;re missing it! I&#39;ll probably also ask you where you&#39;re located and if there are any other payment methods that might work for you.</p><h2 id="account-management" tabindex="-1">Account Management <a class="header-anchor" href="#account-management" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><h3 id="how-do-i-unsubscribe-from-the-daily-summary-emails" tabindex="-1">How do I unsubscribe from the daily summary emails? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-unsubscribe-from-the-daily-summary-emails" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Email me at <a href="mailto:nathan@taskratchet.com">nathan@taskratchet.com</a> and I can unsubscribe you from the daily emails.</p><h3 id="how-can-i-deactivate-or-delete-my-account" tabindex="-1">How can I deactivate or delete my account? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-can-i-deactivate-or-delete-my-account" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Email me at <a href="mailto:nathan@taskratchet.com">nathan@taskratchet.com</a> letting me know whether you&#39;d like me to delete or just deactivate your account, and I&#39;ll get it done as soon as I can.</p>',28),n=[s];function i(h,d,c,l,m,u){return t(),a("div",null,n)}var p=e(o,[["render",i]]);export{f as __pageData,p as default};
