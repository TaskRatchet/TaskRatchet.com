# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes how TaskRatchet uses and protects any information that you give us. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. If you provide us with personal information through TaskRatchet, you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.

## Website Visitors

Like most websites, TaskRatchet collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. TaskRatchet’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how TaskRatchet’s visitors use its website. From time to time, TaskRatchet may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

TaskRatchet also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. TaskRatchet does not use IP addresses to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to TaskRatchet choose to interact with TaskRatchet in ways that require TaskRatchet to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that TaskRatchet gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.

In each case, TaskRatchet collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with TaskRatchet. TaskRatchet does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

All of the information that is collected on TaskRatchet will be handled in accordance with GDPR legislation.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

TaskRatchet discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of project administrators, employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on TaskRatchet’s behalf or to provide services available through TaskRatchet, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using TaskRatchet, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

TaskRatchet will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to project administrators, employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, TaskRatchet discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, if you give permission to have your information shared, or when TaskRatchet believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of TaskRatchet, third parties, or the public at large.

If you are a registered user of a TaskRatchet website and have supplied your email address, TaskRatchet may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with TaskRatchet and our products.

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. TaskRatchet takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Use of personal information

We use the information you provide to register for an account, receive newsletters, or use certain other services.

We will not sell or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so.

We would like to send you email marketing communication which may be of interest to you from time to time. If you have consented to marketing, you may opt out later.

You have a right at any time to stop us from contacting you for marketing purposes. If you no longer wish to be contacted for marketing purposes, please click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.

## Retention of personal information

We will retain your personal information on our systems only for as long as we need to, for the success of the TaskRatchet service and the programs that support TaskRatchet.

TaskRatchet will not delete personal data from logs or records necessary to the operation, development, or archives of the TaskRatchet service.

When deletion is requested or otherwise required, we will anonymise the data of data subjects and/or remove their information from publicly accessible sites if the deletion of data would break essential systems or damage the logs or records necessary to the operation, development, or archival records of the TaskRatchet service.

-   object to our processing of your personal information; and/or

-   withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information (to the extent such processing is based on consent and consent is the only permissible basis for processing).
