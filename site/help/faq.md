# Frequently Asked Questions

## What does TaskRatchet do?

TaskRatchet lets you commit money on completing one-off tasks by deadlines you set. It acts like a simple todo list,
letting you define your tasks and check them off when they are done.

## Is TaskRatchet free?

Yes! TaskRatchet is free to use forever. You will only be charged if you don't complete a task you've added by the
deadline you chose.

## Why does TaskRatchet need my payment details?

TaskRatchet allows you to commit to completing tasks by a deadline. If you don't make your deadline, you get charged
the amount you pledged on the task. Without your payment details, TaskRatchet isn't effective at ensuring you meet
the deadlines you've set.

## When does TaskRatchet charge me?

Soon after you miss a deadline, TaskRatchet will email you letting you know you're about to be charged, and a
charge will appear in your bank account. You can reply to this email to pause the charge and let me know that the charge
isn't legit. Once I've canceled a charge, it will disappear from your bank account.

## Can I try TaskRatchet out without adding my payment details?

TaskRatchet is not designed to be used without a payment method. Since any charges for late tasks won't succeed without
valid payment details, TaskRatchet won't be able to enforce the commitments you've made. For that reason, new users
are required to add a payment method during the registration process.

## How do I unsubscribe from the daily summary emails?

Email me at nathan@taskratchet.com and I can unsubscribe you from the daily emails.

## How can I deactivate or delete my account?

Email me at nathan@taskratchet.com letting me know whether you'd like me to delete or just deactivate your account, and
I'll get it done as soon as I can.

## Does TaskRatchet support PayPal?

No, but email me at nathan@taskratchet.com anyway to let me know you're missing it! I'll probably also ask you where
you're located and if there are any other payment methods that might work for you.

## Why doesn't TaskRatchet have \[feature\]?

TaskRatchet is built and maintained by a single developer, so I may plan to have certain features that I just haven't
had the time to build yet. Or, maybe I haven't thought of the feature yet! Email me at nathan@taskratchet.com with any
ideas, suggestions, or feedback. I love hearing your ideas!

You can also suggest and vote for ideas [here](https://taskratchet.consider.it/), though I would recommend that you
also email me, since I keep a separate record of missing features and the users who want them.
