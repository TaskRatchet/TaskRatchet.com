# Working with Tasks

Once a task is created, you have a few things you can do with it:

- You can complete the task by clicking the checkbox.
- You can charge the task immediately from inside the task's menu.
- You can edit the task, as long as you're making it harder, from the task's menu.
- You can copy the task from the task's menu, using it as a template for creating a new task.
