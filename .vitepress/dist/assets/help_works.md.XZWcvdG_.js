By doing this, the charge is automatically paused until I can respond to you. Once we&#39;ve agreed that your charge should be cancelled, we&#39;ll go ahead and cancel the charge, or, if it&#39;s already been finalized, we&#39;ll issue you a refund.</p>',20),r=[n];function l(s,d,h,c,m,u){return a(),t("div",null,r)}const k=e(i,[["render",l]]);export{g as __pageData,k as default};
